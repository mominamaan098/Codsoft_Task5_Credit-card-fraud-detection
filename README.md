# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and techniques like oversampling or undersampling are considered for improving results.

## Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in the finance industry. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time can save millions of dollars and protect consumers. This project focuses on creating a machine learning pipeline to detect such transactions effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine. It includes features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables to ensure privacy.

## Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any missing or corrupted data.
2. **Normalization**: Scale the features to ensure that they contribute equally to the model.
3. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Apply techniques such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the classes.

## Model Training

We train a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forests. The steps include:

1. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Training the model on the training set.
3. Validating the model on the testing set.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

## Improvements

To improve the model's performance, we consider techniques like:

- **Oversampling**: Increasing the number of minority class samples.
- **Undersampling**: Decreasing the number of majority class samples.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting the model's parameters to achieve better results.
